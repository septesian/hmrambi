This version of hmrabi in Python is based on the Microsoft Basic version produced by Peter Turnbull which was based on an original Focal program. The Basic form must be at least 45 years old and appeared in a book of 100 Basic game
when game playing on computors was in it infancy. It was converted for a school Raspberry PI club as an exercise in Python.
Unfotunatly it was convereted for an earlier version of Pythonso under the current version there are syntax errors. The main problem is with print function which at the time did not require the output to be in brackets.
I will get round to updating it some time. It dosnt follow the original exactly as there appeared to be some problems with the Basic code and it was difficult to understand the logic.
