This version of hmrabi in Python is based on the Microsoft Basic version modified by Peter Turnbull which in turm was based on a Focal program. It was converted for a school Raspberry PI club.
It unfotunatly it was convereted for an earlier version of Python. The main problem is with print function which at the time did not require the output to be in brackets. I will get round to updating it some time.
It dosnt follow the original exactly as there appeared to be some problems with the Basic code and it was difficult to understand the logic.
